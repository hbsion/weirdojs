## Getting start
This is a complete project for the development of a quiz made with the strongtyped 'typescript'

It consists of a quiz game of 20 questions where the questions are related to the weird things I found about **javascript**. You must answer by selecting (you can use the keyboard too!) one of the given answers. Your score will be higher if you solve it in a short time and with more correct questions. In the end, you can see you on the leaderboard.

Much success!
